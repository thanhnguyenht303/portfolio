                <h1>Analyzing Climate Change with Advanced Machine  Learning Techniques</h1> 
                <p>Climate change is intensifying extreme weather events and disrupting atmospheric circulation patterns, leading to increasingly unpredictable climate behaviors. Our project leverages cutting-edge machine learning and data mining algorithms to enhance the understanding and forecasting of these changes:</p>
                <p>Automated Atmospheric Phenomena Detection: Utilize sophisticated algorithms to automate the detection of critical weather features such as cut-off lows - COLs, closed lows - CLs, and cut-off highs - COHs.</p>
                <p>Deep Learning for Advanced Analysis: Implement deep learning frameworks including Recurrent Neural Networks - RNN, Deep Neural Networks - DNN, Convolutional Neural Networks - CNN, and Self-Organizing Maps - SOM to analyze complex atmospheric data.</p>
                <p>Predictive Modeling for Future Events: Employ predictive models to forecast future occurrences of COLs, utilizing current and historical data to inform our understanding of weather and climate patterns.</p>
